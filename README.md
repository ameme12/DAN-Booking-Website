# 📅 McGill Booking Website

## 🚀 Overview

The **McGill Booking Website** is a responsive web application designed to streamline the process of creating, managing, and attending meetings within an academic setting. Users can register, log in, create bookings, request meetings with professors, respond to availability polls, and view upcoming or past meetings, all in one centralized dashboard.
